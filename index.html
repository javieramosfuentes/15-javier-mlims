                    <h1 id="definition">What is Minecraft ?</h1>
                    <p>Minecraft is an "open world" or sandbox construction video game originally created by the Swedish Markus Persson (commonly known as <q>Notch</q>),
                        and later developed by Mojang Studios (now part of Microsoft). It was released on May 17, 2009, and after numerous changes, 
                        its first stable version "1.0" was published on November 18, 2011.</p>
                        
                    <p> A month before the release of its full version, a version for mobile devices called Minecraft: 
                        <em>Pocket Edition</em> was released on Android, and on November 17 of the same year the same version was released for iOS. On May 9, 2012, 
                        the Xbox 360 and PS3 version of the game was released. All versions of Minecraft have received constant updates since its launch. In October 2014,
                        Minecraft launched its PlayStation Vita edition, developed by Mojang and 4J Studios. This version features the same updates
                        and similar features as the other console versions; it also has a cross-selling system, meaning that when you buy the PlayStation 3 version
                        you also get the PlayStation Vita version. As of September 2014, more than 54 million copies had been sold.</p>
                        
                        <p>On September 15, 2014, it was acquired by the company Microsoft for a value of 2.5 billion US dollars. This event led to the
                        departure of Markus Persson from the company. In November 2016, Microsoft announced the release of the full version of Minecraft: Education Edition.</p>

                        <p>Persson was born in Stockholm, Sweden, to a Finnish mother and Swedish father on June 1, 1979.
                            He resided in Edsbyn for the first seven years of his life, before his family returned to Stockholm. At the age of seven,
                            he began programming on his father's Commodore 128 computer. Having experimented with various 
                            type-in programs he produced his first video game at the age of eight, it was a text-based adventure game.</p>
